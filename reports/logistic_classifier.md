  - F1 Score
  - AUC-ROC
  - Confusion Matrix

## Results

## Results

The model achieved an **accuracy of 75.62%** and an **AUC-ROC of 0.755**, indicating solid overall performance. However, **recall was low (0.27)**, indicating many positives were missed. Precision was **0.68**, with an **F1 score of 0.39**. The confusion matrix is: [[37717, 1994], [11536, 4258]]. The model is biased toward the negative class, resulting in a high number of false negatives. This is due to the high class imbalance towards the negative.
